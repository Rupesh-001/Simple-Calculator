# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end web development concepts, including responsive UI design, interactive functionality, and DOM manipulation.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface:

A clean and intuitive layout with a numerical display and buttons for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).
Buttons for "Clear" (C), "All Clear" (AC) and "Equals" (=) for reset and computation.
Responsive Design:

Compatible with different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Dynamic Functionality:

The user can input values by clicking the buttons.
The result of operations is displayed in real-time on a screen or display area.
Lightweight and Efficient:

Minimal dependencies, using only HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic.
